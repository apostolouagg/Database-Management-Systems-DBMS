The project involves working with real-world ship data in PostgreSQL, loading three CSV files: 

- Positions.csv (containing ship positions over time) 

- Vessels.csv (static ship details like type and flag)

- VesselTypes.csv (describing ship types)


The task involves answering **_five key questions_**: querying the data, tuning performance using buffers and parallelism, creating indexes to speed up queries, and partitioning the dataset. 

Each step requires analyzing query execution time, improving efficiency, and providing explanations using SQL commands. 

Deliverables include SQL scripts, screenshots, and a detailed report demonstrating database management skills and performance optimization techniques.
